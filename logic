I want to create a genetic algorithm to effectively play connect 4
each member of the population will be programmed with an evolutionary program, to evolve finite state machines
I will be trying to do this without looking anything up

the connect 4 game will be controlled by a 7x6 array, where each member represents a slot in the board
a member can select any of the 7 columns to drop a token into
the decision of where to drop the token will be decided by the state machine
the input to the state machine will be a 42 long string containing the info of the board
0 will be an empty slot, 1 for the member tokens, and 2 for the opponent member tokens

each member of the population will be an array of data
it will contain an array representing the state machine, and an array to hold data about the current game it plays
the state machine will be defined as an array which contains multiple arrays each representing a state
each state will have at 3 output transitions, one for each different number an input string can contain
each state will also have a number 0-6, representing which column to drop a token if the state machine ends on that state
every member of the population must have at least 7 states, 1 for each potential output column, but it can have more

when the entire input string has been considered, the state that is ended upon will decide the column to place a token
in the event that a member of the population places a token in a full column, then the token will be placed to the right of that column
if there are no places left, then the game is considered a tie.

fitness will be decided by a tournament, where the winner will move on and the loser will die
in the event of a tie, in which the whole board is filled with no 4 in a rows, then the member with the most 3 in a rows will live
in the event of a tie, and there are an equal number of 3 in a rows, then a random choice will occur
the winner of the game will create a child, with an exact state machine, with at least 1 mutation
a mutation could be the addition of a state, removal of a state, or a change in the location of an outward transition
I will start with only 1 mutation, but may change to more later
